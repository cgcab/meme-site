# Problem

1. Excessive Initial Data Load for Memes: Initially, the application was loading all pages of meme data at once, which resulted in numerous database queries and significant overhead, especially on the first page. This approach not only impacted performance but also led to unnecessary data fetching, slowing down the user experience.

2. Redundant Author Queries: Each time a comment or meme was loaded, a new query was made to fetch the author information, even if the same author data had already been fetched before. This duplication created redundant requests, increasing the server load and network usage unnecessarily.

3. Automatic Comment Loading for All Memes: By default, all comments for every meme were loaded as soon as the memes appeared on the page, regardless of whether the user intended to view those comments. This led to a large volume of unnecessary data being fetched, especially on pages with many memes, further impacting load times and resource usage.

# Solution

1. Paginated Loading of Memes with Infinite Scroll Option: Instead of loading all pages of memes at once, we now load only the first page of memes on initial render. To enable users to access more memes, we implemented pagination or an infinite scrolling mechanism. This approach allows the app to fetch additional pages only when needed, reducing the initial load and optimizing data usage as users interact with the feed.

2. Author Data Caching Using React Query: To prevent redundant requests for author information, we implemented caching using React Query. React Query's caching mechanism allows previously fetched author data to be stored and reused, marked as stale after a specified time. This ensures that once an author's data is fetched, it does not need to be re-requested unless necessary, thereby reducing network calls and improving load times.

3. On-Demand Comment Loading with Pagination: Comments for each meme are now fetched only when the user explicitly opens the comment section. By default, only the first page of comments is loaded, and users can then click a "Load More" button to retrieve additional comments if desired. This reduces the initial data load, optimizes resource usage, and improves performance by fetching comments only as needed.
